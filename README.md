## Welcome to the IJC's Proteomics Group Git-Hub

The IJC proteomic unit develop and apply advanced proteomic analysis that are used for different aspects of clinical and health sciences such as biomarker discovery, drug target identification and food technology.
The Proteomics unit of the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute offers mass spectrometry services to the academic and the private sector.The proteomics unit belongs to the scientific and technical services (SCT) of our institution. The principal activity of the Scientific and Technical Services (SCT) is to support academic research despite the private for-profit organizations are also increasingly interested in accessing our services. Our unit is part of the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) and the Proteomics Network platform (ProteoRed)

One of the main activities of the unit is to promote the incorporation of proteomics as a necessary tool for the development of clinical and basic projects in our institution.

One of the great challenges of biomedical research and precision medicine is the description of the mechanisms underlying pathological processes and, based on this, to define measurable biomarkers in a standardized way and new therapeutic targets, generally of a protein nature
